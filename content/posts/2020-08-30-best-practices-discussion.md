Notes by Jorge, halfway compiled by Naoto

We find honesty in the practice when we are "purely" moving as a transcendental body. Compare it to a production with, for example, lasers, robots and drone sound when technology starts to dictate the performance. Not only it dictates the stage, engineers and designers need to find a solution rather than a proposal.

Practices exist in both technology (e.g., video making) and dancing. In a classical theater context, technology is a service for a dance piece (work-for). In a Choreographic Coding Lab format, people with different practices come together and see what happens (work-with). The specific format is philanthropic and voluntary, and not the whole process and methodology are documented. Also, while it is a work-with concept, the time constraint (5 days) often forces participants to find a solution from technical or design point of view. The third type of practices is our "best practices", which aims to find practices through experimenting with movements and technology over network, which is our concept. The fundamental context in our practices is that we perform online; thus we transfer audiovisual contents to each other. We add more context by introducing, for instance, a video synthesizer, DMX-controlled lights and smoke machines, and sound. Each context adds more contents and constraints to the performance.

Notes
--------

Dance is a pure form 

Context/ techConten. Vs Concept/ dance  

LIMITATION - without tech 

PURITY !! What are the elements that we need 4 the practice to happen 

When you stop the flow ?? Tech: dance or code

Doing Better?? Better what?  

Mozilla hubs 

——

METHODOLOGIES ?? 

Trackable qualities ?? — what qualities extract from measurement
